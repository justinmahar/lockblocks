<h1>Usage</h1>

LockBlocks is a command line utility that takes two arguments: an origin directory, and a target directory.

```shell
lockblocks origin target
```

Files, directories, and code blocks are transferred from the origin directory to the target directory as per the configuration and special tags found in the origin files.

The origin directory must contain a config file called `lockblocks.yml` for LockBlocks to run. See below for configuration options.

By default, `warn` and `error` level events will be printed to the console. Pass the `--verbose` arg to print `info` and `action` type events as well. Pass `--silent` to silence all console output. [Logs](#log) are saved to `lockblocks.log` by default.

### Config (lockblocks.yml)

You must create a config file in the root of the project called `lockblocks.yml`. This file must be present for LockBlocks to work.

Field specifications are as follows:

#### renameFiles

Specify files and directories to be renamed.

Specification:

```yaml
renameFiles: Reassignment[]
```

`Reassignment` is an object with the following fields:

- `from: string` - The previous file or directory name.
- `to: string` - The new file or directory name.

Example:

```yaml
renameFiles:
  - from: src/config.json
    to: src/settings.json
  - from: src/comps
    to: src/components
```

#### replaceFiles

Specify what files or directories to replace completely with the origin. The target file will be removed, then the origin file will be copied to the target.

Changes will only be made if there are file differences.

Specification:

```yaml
replaceFiles: (string | OriginTarget)[]
```

You can specify an array of strings, which are filenames relative to the root, or a pair of from/to filenames if you'd like to rename the file during the operation.

`OriginTarget` is an object with the following fields:

- `origin: string` - The filename in the origin project.
- `target: string` - The filename in the target project.

If specifying origin or target, both are required for a renaming to occur.

Example:

```yaml
replaceFiles:
  - core
  - .node-version
```

#### fillFiles

Specify files to copy to the target only if they don't already exist. If a directory is specified, missing files and directories will be copied recursively.

Specification:

```yaml
fillFiles: (string | OriginTarget)[]
```

You can specify an array of strings, which are filenames relative to the root, or a pair of from/to filenames if you'd like to fill a different filename/dir during the operation.

`OriginTarget` is an object with the following fields:

- `origin: string` - The filename in the origin project.
- `target: string` - The filename in the target project.

If specifying origin or target, both are required for a renaming to occur.

Example:

```yaml
fillFiles:
  - src/components
  - origin: defaults/settings/default.yml
    target: src/settings/settings.yml
```

#### deleteFiles

Specify files and directories to be deleted in the target.

Specification:

```yaml
deleteFiles: string[]
```

Example:

```yaml
deleteFiles:
  - media/icon-placeholder.png
  - src/components/LegacyWrapper.tsx
  - src/stuff
```

#### excludePaths

Specify the paths to exclude scanning for [lock tags](#lock-tags). Paths are relative to the origin directory (do not prefix paths with `./`). Can be directories or files.

Only UTF-8 files will be scanned for tags. These paths are only applicable to files scanned for tags.

Specification:

- `excludePaths: string[]`

Example:

```yaml
excludePaths:
  - .git
  - .lockblocks
  - node_modules
  - README.md
```

#### updateJson and updateYaml

Specify the fields to be updated in JSON and YAML files.

This is useful for keeping fields (scripts, deps, etc) updated in `package.json`, or for updating fields in YAML files.

Specification:

For JSON files:

```yaml
updateJson: ConfigUpdate[]
```

For YAML files:

```yaml
updateYaml: ConfigUpdate[]
```

The value is an array of `ConfigUpdate`s. These define how a config file should be updated. A path to the file is required and LockBlocks expects the file to contain an object at the root. All other fields are optional. You can specify fields to be updated, deleted, and renamed. You can also specify the behavior for each update. See below for details.

`ConfigUpdate` is an object with the following fields:

- `path: string` - The path to the file to update
- `root: FieldUpdateOptions` - An object specifying how the fields should be updated. See below.
- `renameFields: Reassignment[]` - An array of from/to pairs for renaming fields.
- `updateFields: FieldUpdate[]` - An array of updates specs. See below.
- `deleteFields: string[]` - An array of field names. Supports dot notation for nested fields (e.g. my.field.name)

`FieldUpdateOptions` is an object with the following fields:

- `merge: boolean` - _Optional._ Copy all fields from origin to target, leaving all others.
- `fill: boolean` - _Optional._ Copy only missing fields from origin to target.
- `prune: boolean` - _Optional._ Remove all target fields missing from origin.
- `replace: boolean` - _Optional._ Copy all fields from origin to target, deleting all others. Same as merge + prune.

`FieldUpdate` is an object with the following fields:

- `key: string` - The key of the field to update. Supports dot notation for nested fields (e.g. my.field.name)
- `as: string` - _Optional._ When specified, this field name will be used in the target. Supports dot notation for nested fields (e.g. new.key.title).
- Any of the `FieldUpdateOptions` fields. These only apply if the field is an object. Otherwise, it is simply replaced.

`Reassignment` is an object with the following fields:

- `from: string` - The previous field name.
- `to: string` - The new field name.

The `root` option will affect all fields at the root of the file. This expects a `FieldUpdateOptions` object (see above).

Order of updates:

- Apply root updates
- Rename fields
- Update fields
- Delete fields

Example:

```yaml
updateJson:
  - path: package.json
    root:
      fill: true
    renameFields:
      - from: oldName
        to: newName
    updateFields:
      - key: version
        as: starterVersion
      - key: scripts
        merge: true
      - key: dependencies
        merge: true
      - key: devDependencies
        merge: true
    deleteFields:
      - scripts.remove
updateYaml:
  - path: settings/settings.yml
    renameFields:
      - from: analyticsCode
        to: analyticsMeasurementId
      - from: site.header
        to: site.title
    updateFields:
      - key: defaults
        merge: true
    deleteFields:
      - theme
```

#### log

LockBlocks saves a log of the updates made to `lockblocks.log`, unless otherwise specified with the `log` option.

You can specify a filename to change the output file, or specify `false` to disable logging.

Specification:

```yaml
log: boolean | string
```

If `log` is not specified, or if `log` is set to `true`, logs will be saved to `lockblocks.log` by default. If set to `false`, no logs will be saved.

Examples:

```yaml
log: true # Logs are saved to lockblocks.log when true
```

```yaml
log: false # No logs will be saved
```

```yaml
log: logs/updater.log # Logs are saved to this file
```

Log levels:

- `action` - Indicates a change to the files in your project.
- `info` - Indicates helpful information about the execution.
- `warn` - Indicates a warning that may require your attention.
- `error` - Indicates an error that occurred during execution.

All file changes are indicated by the `action` log level. These identify actual file changes (write, copy, delete, move) in the target.

In addition to all `action` log events, you can also use a simple `git status` to confirm which files were modified after an update.

### Lock Tags

LockBlocks will scan the origin directory for special tags that allow you to transfer and rename files, and synchronize code blocks.

These tags can be placed in comments. Only UTF-8 files will be scanned.

#### Replace File Tag

Use the `[lock-all/]` tag anywhere in a file to cause the entire file to be replaced in the target.

```ts
// [lock-all/]
```

#### Code Block Tags

Surround code with the `[lock:block]` and `[/lock:block]` tags to cause a block of code in the origin to be replaced in the target file of the same name.

The `block` part of this tag should be a unique ID that names that block in the file. This convention allows you to have multiple locked code blocks per file.

The IDs need only be unique for each given file (you can use the same ID in multiple files).

You can also lock a single line with the following: `[lock:block/]`

```ts
// [lock:block]
// Code
// ...
// [/lock:block]

// ...

// [lock:another-block]
// More code
// ...
// [/lock:another-block]

// ...

// Single line locked // [lock:single-line/]
```

#### Rename File Tags

Add the tag `[lock-rename: path/to/previous/filename.txt /]` to a file to rename the old filepath to the current one. LockBlocks will search the target for the old filepath and rename the file to the current filepath if the old file exists. Paths are relative to the root.

You can specify multiple rename tags in any given file.

```ts
// [lock-rename: path/to/previous/filename.txt /]
```

#### Ignore Tag

Add the `[lock-ignore/]` tag to tell LockBlocks to ignore the line and any other tags it may contain.

```ts
// [lock-all/] [lock-ignore/]
```

#### Tag Ejection

In the target project, simply remove a tag from the file to prevent LockBlocks from making that update.

For instance, you can remove the `[lock:block] ... [/lock:block]` tags around a block of code to "eject" from the starter. That code block will no longer be updated.
